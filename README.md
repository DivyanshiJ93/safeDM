# SafeDM 
*A gentle, privacy first Chrome extension that flags creepy DMs and helps you protect your peace online.*

## 🌸 Overview
SafeDM is a feminine, supportive, privacy-first Chrome extension that detects creepy, manipulative, or uncomfortable DMs in real time across platforms like **Reddit, Instagram Web, X (Twitter), and LinkedIn**.

It highlights red-flag messages with a soft hot-pink badge and opens a warm, supportive panel that explains the risk and offers confident, boundary-setting replies — all fully **on-device**.

## 💗 Motivation
SafeDM was created because online DMs often feel uncomfortable or unsafe.  
Most tools focus on blocking — none offer emotional support.

> “This message isn’t okay. You deserve to feel safe.”  
This is the core idea behind SafeDM.
